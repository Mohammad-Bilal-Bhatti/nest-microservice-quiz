## Description

This is the quiz application to check my ability to work with nestjs.

Mistakenly i typed film as flim so please ignore it ;)

This repository is crafted as monorepo for hosting multiple applications. 
1. Gateway
2. Users service
3. Flims service

### System Overview

- Gateway as name suggested - it is door to our application and handles communication between each microservice.
- User microservice - is responsible for handing user registration and login
- Flims microservice - is responsible for handling flims CRUD and search facilities
- The database used in the following microservices is myqsl database and typeorm is used on top of it.
- The application used redis as message borker as a middleware to communicate with each microservice.
- Application is using cache mechanism on GET routes for 60 sec as TTL and behind the scenes used redis to store cache data
- The flim service is protected by jwt-auth guard
- Stream based logging is setup in each microservice and gateway - because stram based logging is more flexable to work as compared to file based logging.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Prerequisites

1. You must have docker running to your system.

```bash
# Start database and message broker containers in detatched mode
$ docker compose up -d
```

2. you have to make sure you have following databases exists with names
- users_db
- flims_db

if not try to create it by [adminer](http://localhost:8080) - free an open source sql client

## Running the apps

```bash
# Run gateway service
$ nest start gateway

# Run users service
$ nest start users-service

# Run flims service
$ nest start flims-service

# If you wanted to store log to file use redirect syntax to achieve it
$ nest start gateway >> gateway.logs
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Migrations

Migration context
- users
- flims

Each migration context is related to each microservice

```bash
# Run migration
$ migration:<context>:run

# Revert migration
$ migration:<context>:revert

# Create migration
$ migration:<context>:create
```
